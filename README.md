**rptoon**\
An attempt to restore broken rptoon plugin for rw 3.7 d3d9 from this [repo](https://github.com/sigmaco/rwsrc-v37-pc/tree/master)

**Build**\
Currently only MS Visual Studio build support. So required any version with c99 compiler support and installed MS DirectX 9.0c SDK with `%DXSDK_DIR%` environment variable is set. Generate `.sln` file by [premake5](https://premake.github.io/) and build debug or release lib
